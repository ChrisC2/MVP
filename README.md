**Description:** 
This is a small project I built within a day.
Its a full stack mobile app which allows users to view trending Instagram photos taken within a 5 mile radius of their current location.

* Utilized Ionic’s hybrid platform to create a mobile compatible app and responsive interface
* Employed Google Maps & Geolocation API to fetch a user’s current location and render their location on a map
* Leveraged Angular’s two-way data binding to dynamically render photos and their modal views on click events
* Adhered to RESTful API principles by building a Node.js/Express server which managed the Instagram API calls for the client

Tech Stack: Angular.js, Ionic, Cordova, Node.js, Express, Google Maps API, HTML5 Geolocation, Instagram API
